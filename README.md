# Selenium 

This mini‐automation project is a Python script that uses Selenium’s Edge WebDriver to open Instagram, log in with your credentials, handle the “Save Your Login Info?” popup, search for the “cbitosc” account, click Follow if you’re not already subscribed, scrape its display name, bio, and post/follower/following counts using reliable relative XPaths and explicit waits, save those details into a simple text file, and then cleanly close the browser.
